            <p>
                <b>What is Phishing?</b><br><br>
                Phishing is a type of social engineering attack used by attackers to steal sensitive data of users, such as login credentials and credit card numbers. 
                Actually, these attacks are very common because they are easy to perform. if you go through the internet you can see a lot of tools and applications there in order to perform those.
                
                In these attacks, the attacker is misleading the user and intend to perform actions that they really don't want to do. 
                based on the type of attacks, we can identify some types of categories, I would like to mention four of them as Spear phishing, Whaling, Vishing, Email phishing. 
                All the attack types expectation is same, that is stealing the sensitive information, those are different each one of them according to the method they used to send 
                the malicious link, some phishing attacks are targetting persons, some are sharing the malicious link using SMS or via email, that's 
                how they differ each one.

                <p>
                    <br><br><b>How is this happen?</b><br><br>
                    when we analyse those we can identify all the methods are using the same method which is sending a 
                    malicious link to the user via email or SMS or anyhow. 
                    the task of those attacks is misleading the user and redirect to another page. as an example imagine we get an email, 
                    its looks like a message from Facebook and they said “your account has a security error, log in with this link and fix it”, 
                    when you click the link it redirect to page that looks like a Facebook login page, apparently there is no any doubt because 
                    it really likes the Facebook login page but it can be a phishing page, so you enter your login credentials and attacker stealing your 
                    login credentials since the page is fake. Someone can steal the bank account details following the same method, it is also an attacker 
                    misleading the user with a fake login page.
                </p>

                    <b>protect ourselves against phishing </b><br><br>
                    Under this topic I am going to discuss how do we identify phishing attacks and how do we protect ourselves against phishing attacks.
                    
                    the following image shows a phishing mail, I received it via Gmail, most of the time if Gmail find any suspicious things
                     about a mail, it will send to the spam folder, but some are not going to that and they are appearing as a normal mail.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <center><img src="images/phishing3.jpg" alt=phishing></center>
                <p>look at that email, it provides a link in order to change our password, can we trust it? no right, look at the 
                    provided link, we can see it is not a proper link, it doesn't seem like the Facebook link, so we want to avoid 
                    clicking this link, this is the basic type of phishing and now attackers using sophisticated methods, 
                    now they are not put the link like this, they are masking it or hyperlink it, then the user is not able to see the actual link.
                    <br><br>check out the following image.  
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <center><img src="images/phishing4.jpg" alt=phishing></center>
                <p>In the above mail, the link is masked. now it seems like a regular Facebook link, but under that, it hides the malicious link, 
                    after clicking that it will be redirected to a page as follows.
                </p>
    
                <br><br> 
                <center><img src="images/phishing5.jpg" alt=phishing></center>
                <br><br>

                <p>
                    The above image shows the interface of a fake security login page of Facebook. As you can see in the URL bar, 
                    the link is not like the original Facebook page, it's different, so we can realize this is a phishing page, 
                    and remember if a website asks your login credentials again and again, there must be something wrong because most of the 
                    time attacker after getting the job done, redirected you into the original page otherwise the user might be making 
                    suspicious thoughts about the procedure since you entered the login credentials but you haven't log in, you have 
                    a doubt about that, So attacker after getting information via phishing page redirected you into the original page, 
                    so you want to enter the login credentials again, that's what I mentioned, you have to enter details 2 times. I want to
                     say this is my personal experience: once I entered 2 or 3 times login details, but I haven't any idea about that, but I felt 
                     something wrong, then after checking the browsing history I realized it was a phishing page, so I immediately changed my password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am afraid I discussed the key facts about phishing, what is phishing? how is this happen and how do we protect ourselves from those. 
                    In order to protect yourselves against phishing, all I want to say is concern about this stuff and it's not a critical type of attack 
                    that we can’t stop, it's a simple social engineering attack, avoid clicking suspicious links, check the URL, check the sender and many
                     more things you should follow to protect from those.
                </p>
